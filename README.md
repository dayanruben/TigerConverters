# TigerConverters
Compiler of Tiger language integrated to XAML code.


## Project Description

Tiger is a small languaje based on expressions, so it's perfect for writing the body of a WPF/SL converter. As for performance, the code is parsed only once and a System.Linq expression is generated and used as the body of the converter.
